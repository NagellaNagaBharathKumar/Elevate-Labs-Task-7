# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
Review installed Brave extensions, identify any suspicious or unnecessary ones, and remove them to improve security and performance.

## Tools Used
- **Brave**
- Brave Extensions Manager (`brave://extensions/`)

## Steps Followed
1. Opened **brave://extensions/** in Brave.  
2. Enabled **Developer mode** to view details and extension IDs.  
3. Reviewed installed extensions, checking their purpose, publisher, and permissions.  
4. Verified reviews and legitimacy of the extensions in the Chrome Web Store.  
5. Since both installed extensions were legitimate and useful, no removal was required.  
6. Restarted Brave and confirmed normal browser performance.

## Extensions Found
- **Grammarly: AI Writing and Grammar Checker App**  
  - Publisher: Grammarly, Inc.  
  - Purpose: Provides grammar and writing assistance.  
  - Permissions: Access to sites for text correction.  
  - Status: **Kept** (Trusted and actively used).

  - Publisher: McAfee, LLC.  
  - Purpose: Provides web safety ratings and phishing protection.  
  - Permissions: Site access and browsing activity.  
  - Status: **Kept** (Legitimate and useful security extension).  

## How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users
- **Data theft**: Capture passwords, cookies, or browsing data.  
- **Ad/affiliate injection**: Modify web content for ad revenue.  
- **Tracking**: Monitor browsing habits without consent.

## Conclusion

Both are legitimate, widely used, and provide useful functionality, so they were **kept**.  
Regularly auditing browser extensions helps ensure no suspicious or malicious add-ons are present.
